# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

## Title

**Penetration Testing on scanme.nmap.org, h4cker.org, Metasploitable 2, and WebSploit VMs**

## Objective

To identify vulnerabilities across multiple targets, including scanme.nmap.org,
h4cker.org, Metasploitable 2 virtual machine, and WebSploit containers. The goal is to exploit
discovered vulnerabilities, assess potential impacts, and provide actionable recommendations for
mitigation.

## Phase 1: Information Gathering

### Tools to Consider:

1. **dnsenum**: DNS enumeration can be conducted to map out the domain and subdomainstructure of the targets.
2. **Spiderfoot**: Public information can be collected through OSINT using Spiderfoot.
3. **Metagoofil**: Metadata can be extracted from public documents associated with the targets.
4. **Exiftool**: Embedded data in image files can be analyzed.
5. **Enum4linux**: Shared resources and user accounts on the targetsâ€™ network can be enumerated.
6. **Nmap**: Open ports and services on scanme.nmap.org, h4cker.org, Metasploitable 2, andWebSploit VMs can be identified using network scans.
7. **theHarvester**: Useful for email and employee information collection.
8. **Recon-ng**: A framework for conducting reconnaissance and gathering detailed information.
9. **Maltego**: Visualizes relationships between entities for deeper OSINT insights.
10. **Amass**: Performs in-depth subdomain enumeration and OSINT.
11. **Assetfinder**: A fast tool for discovering subdomains.
12. **Sublist3r**: Automates subdomain enumeration for public-facing targets.
13. **WhatWeb**: Identifies technologies used by web applications.
14. **Wappalyzer**: Browser extension to detect web technologies.

Other tools can be included to further enhance information gathering.

## Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning

### Tools to Consider:

1. **Nessus Essentials**: Nessus can be used to identify vulnerabilities across IP ranges.
2. **GVM (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)**: In-depth vulnerabilities can be discovered usingGVM.
3. **Nikto**: Nikto can be utilized to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in web servers ofscanme.nmap.org and h4cker.org.
4. **Burp Suite (Community Edition)**: Burp Suite helps analyze web application vulnerabilities.
5. **Acunetix**: Identifies vulnerabilities in web applications and services.
6. **Zap (OWASP ZAP)**: Scans web applications for vulnerabilities.
7. **Wpscan**: Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in WordPress websites.
8. **Arachni**: A feature-rich web application security scanner.
9. **Retire.js**: Detects vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries.
10. **SSLyze**: Analyzes the SSL/TLS configuration of web servers.
11. **TestSSL**: Another tool for testing SSL/TLS implementations.
12. **Nuclei**: A fast tool for vulnerability scanning using community-driven templates.
13. **Dirbuster**: Identifies hidden directories and files.
14. **Gobuster**: Another effective directory and file brute-forcing tool.
15. **Fuff**: A fast web fuzzer for directories, files, and parameters.

These tools should be used to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment.

## Phase 3: Exploitation

### Tools to Consider:

1. **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**: Exploitation frameworks can be used to target vulnerabilitiesidentified on scanme.nmap.org, h4cker.org, Metasploitable 2 VM, and WebSploit containers.
2. **Windows Exploit Suggester (WES)**: This tool helps identify potential exploits for Windowsservers.
3. **SQLMap**: SQL injection vulnerabilities on web applications can be exploited with SQLMap.
4. **Cobalt Strike**: Assists in advanced exploitation and post-exploitation.
5. **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)**: Exploits browser-based vulnerabilities.
6. **Hydra**: Automates brute-force attacks to test authentication mechanisms.
7. **John the Ripper**: Cracks hashed passwords to test password strength.
8. **Medusa**: A parallel brute-forcing tool supporting multiple protocols.
9. **CrackMapExec**: Automates the enumeration and exploitation of SMB and other services.
10. **MSFVenom**: Generates custom payloads for exploitation.
11. **Responder**: Captures hashes in network poisoning attacks.
12. **Setoolkit**: Useful for social engineering attacks.
13. **Hashcat**: A high-speed password recovery tool.
14. **Aircrack-ng**: A suite for wireless network security testing.
15. **Wifiphisher**: A tool to conduct Wi-Fi phishing attacks.

Additional exploitation techniques can be explored depending on the results of previous phases.

## Phase 4: Post-Exploitation Activities

### Activities to Perform:

1. **Maintaining Access**: Methods can be used to create a backdoor for future access.
2. **Pivoting**: Lateral movement within the network of scanme.nmap.org, h4cker.org, Metasploitable2, and WebSploit VMs can be achieved.
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Techniques can be used to extract critical data.
4. **Evidence Cleanup**: Traces of exploitation can be removed to avoid detection.

### Tools to Consider:

1. **PowerShell Empire**: Automates post-exploitation activities on Windows systems.
2. **Mimikatz**: Extracts credentials from memory.
3. **BloodHound**: Maps Active Directory relationships for privilege escalation.
4. **Impacket**: Assists in SMB-based post-exploitation tasks.
5. **LaZagne**: Extracts stored passwords from Windows and Linux systems.
6. **Netcat**: A versatile tool for creating reverse shells.
